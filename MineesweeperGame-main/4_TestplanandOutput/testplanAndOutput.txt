Test Plan:
1 The input consists of an arbitrary number of fields.
2 The first line of input contains an integer which stands for the level of the game i.e., beginner, intermediate, expert and custom input. 
3 The second line of each field contains two integers n and m which stands for the number of rows and columns of the field respectively.
4 Each safe square is represented by an “_” character (without the quotes) and each mine square is represented by an “*” character (also without the quotes). 
5 The first field line where n = m = 0 represents the end of input and should not be processed.

Test Cases:
1.If the player collects all the mines present within the grid.
Game Win.
2.If the player got mine in grid.
You Lost.

Expected Results:
1 If a player completes the game by finding all the mines then display with a message called “Game Win” 
2 If a player find the Mine in game then display with a message called “You lost” and all squares are revealed.
